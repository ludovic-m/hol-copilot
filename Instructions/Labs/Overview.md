# Exercise 1

# Exercise 2

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat in "Ask" mode to understand unfamiliar codebases
- Learn how to efficiently navigate and analyze project structure with AI assistance
- Understand how to identify build processes, testing frameworks, and dependencies
- Develop strategies for onboarding to new projects using GitHub Copilot

## 🍎 Scenario: Your First Day at The Daily Harvest

## 🤖 Introduction to GitHub Copilot Chat

## 🧠 Choosing the Right AI Model

### 💰 Model Pricing and Usage Limits

### 🔄 Experimenting with Different Models

## 🔍 Step 1: Understanding the Project Purpose

Let's start by getting a high-level understanding of what this application does.

## 🏗️ Step 2: Analyzing Project Structure

Now let's understand how the code is organized and what the folder structure tells us.

## 💻 Step 3: Identifying Technologies and Frameworks

Understanding the tech stack is crucial for knowing what skills you'll need and how to work effectively.

## 🔨 Step 4: Understanding the Build Process

Now let's figure out how to actually build and run this application.

## 🧪 Step 5: Understanding the Testing Strategy

Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality. Let's explore what testing frameworks and practices are in place.

# Exercise 3

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:
- Understand how to use GitHub Copilot's Autocomplete feature and Edit mode for code modifications
- Learn to write comprehensive unit tests with AI assistance
- Improve existing code coverage using intelligent test generation
- Understand best practices for AI-assisted testing

## 📊 Step 1: Baseline Testing and Coverage Analysis

Before we start writing new tests, let's establish a baseline by running the existing test suite and checking our current code coverage. We can use what we learned in Exercise 2 about how to run tests in this project.

## ✏️ Step 2: Using Autocomplete to Generate One Additional Unit Test

To start off, you'd like to generate one additional unit test. We can use GitHub Copilot's Autocomplete feature to make an addition to the unit test suite.

## 💭 Step 3: Using Edit Mode to Generate Additional Unit Tests

There are many other tests that we can write for `CartPage`. While we could continue using Autocomplete to generate them, that would be very slow and cumbersome. We'll instead use GitHub Copilot's Edit mode to create comprehensive unit tests.

## 🎓 Step 4: Best Practices and Code Review

Now that you've generated comprehensive unit tests, it's important to ensure they follow industry best practices and maintain high quality. This step focuses on using GitHub Copilot to review and refine your testing approach.

# Exercise 4

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:
- Understand what GitHub Copilot Agent mode is and when to use it
- Learn how Agent mode differs from Chat and Edit modes
- Experience how Agent mode autonomously makes changes across multiple files
- Use Agent mode to achieve a specific, measurable goal (80%+ code coverage)
- Observe and understand Agent mode's decision-making process
- Apply best practices for delegating complex tasks to AI agents
